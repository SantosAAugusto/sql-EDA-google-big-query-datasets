# Objective
This repository have the objective of explain how to proceed with Exploration Data Analysis (EDA), using SQL, answering questions
of a diversity amount of Google BigQuery Datasets.

## Description
Previously, questions were elaborated, trying to simulate real questions about real datasets.
After, using SQL, those questions were answered with queries.

## Google BigQuery
Google BigQuery is a fully managed, cloud-based data warehouse designed for real-time analysis of large datasets. It uses a serverless architecture, meaning no infrastructure, scalability, or maintenance concerns. Supporting standard SQL, BigQuery can process terabytes of data in seconds, making it ideal for fast and efficient analytics.

### How is Google BigQuery useful for businesses and projects?
Large-Scale Data Analysis:
Businesses can analyze massive datasets (e.g., logs, transactions, IoT data) quickly and efficiently without complex infrastructure.

Integration with BI Tools:
Easily integrates with BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker for real-time dashboards and reports.

Machine Learning and AI:
With BigQuery ML, you can build and train machine learning models directly in the database using SQL, useful for prediction, classification, and predictive analytics.

Flexible Costs:
Pay-as-you-go pricing ensures businesses only pay for what they use, reducing unnecessary expenses.

Collaboration and Sharing:
Data and queries can be easily shared across teams, enhancing collaboration in data analysis projects.

Learning and Development:
For professionals and students, BigQuery is an excellent tool for training SQL and data analysis skills due to its simplicity and processing power.

### Use Cases
Sales Analysis: Businesses can analyze sales trends, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

Log Monitoring: IT projects can process and analyze large volumes of logs to identify issues or optimize performance.

Machine Learning Projects: Data science teams can use BigQuery ML to build predictive models directly in the database.
